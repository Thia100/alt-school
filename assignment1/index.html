        <p>Hello I'm Fathia Diekola Gbolahan from the Karatu 2025 track at ALT-school Africa</p>
        <p>Date of Birth: 5th of May, 2006</p>
        <p>ALT- School ID:ALT/SOE/025/3602</p>
        <p>I'm from Osun state nigeria from a family of five. I'm the second daughter and I enjoy reading (especially mystery and detective novels) when I'm not coding.</p>
        <p>I joined this program to upskill, cause I'm already familiar with web development. My goal is to become a proficient web developer and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
